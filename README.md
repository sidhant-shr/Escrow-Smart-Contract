## Working
.Parties agree on the terms: The buyer, seller, and an optional arbitrator define the conditions for the transaction.
.Funds are locked: The buyer sends the agreed-upon amount to the smart contract, which securely holds the funds.
.Fulfillment of conditions: The seller provides the product or service, and the buyer acknowledges its receipt.
.Release of funds: Upon confirmation that all conditions are met, the smart contract automatically releases the funds to the seller.
.Dispute resolution: If there's a disagreement, the arbitrator steps in to review the evidence and make a fair decision
